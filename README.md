## Required Packages:
cv2, keras, sklearn, tensorflow, matplotlib, sys, pandas, os, numpy

## Bird image classifier execution:
1. Install all the required packages.
2. Use Jupyter Notebook (Preferably Google COLAB) with GPU runtime.
3. Execute all the cells one by one in 'bird_image_classifier.ipynb'.
